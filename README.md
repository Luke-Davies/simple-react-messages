# Pure React Messages App

A messages app implemented purely in react (i.e. without redux etc).

This app was built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

To start the app in dev mode run `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will run the app on http://localhost:3000

No tests have been added to the default ones generated by create-react-app.
